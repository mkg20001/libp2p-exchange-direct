# libp2p-exchange-direct

Data Exchange component that uses the swarm to directly dial the taget peer if it is connected

## Use-Case

The use case for this exchange component is to allow quick upgrades of a libp2p-circuit connection using transports that require the data-exchange component.

## WIP

> Everything WIP. Tests WIP too so I have no idea if it works.
